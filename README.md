# Time Series Forecasting

This repository shows projects that deal with time series analysis in the financial industry for forecasting, risk modeling, and anomaly detection. Here are some datasets where I apply time series techniques to simulate realistic financial scenarios and refine my data science skills.

### 1. Bitcoin Historical Data (Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting)

**Dataset:** Bitcoin Historical Data

**Description:** This dataset contains minute-level Bitcoin price data from 2012–2021, including Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC), Volume, and Weighted Price. It is useful for trend analysis, volatility modeling, and forecasting.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[Price Forecasting:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Bitcoin-Price-Forecasting.git)** Used ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet to predict future Bitcoin prices.
- **[Volatility Analysis:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Bitcoin-Volatility-Analysis.git)** Implemented GARCH models to study price fluctuations and risk.
- **[Anomaly Detection:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Bitcoin-Anomaly-Detection.git)** Applied isolation forests and autoencoders to detect flash crashes and price spikes.
- **Trading Strategy Backtesting:** Tested momentum-based strategies with moving averages and Bollinger Bands.

### 2. S&P 500 Stock Data (Stock Price Forecasting & Portfolio Management)

**Dataset:** S&P 500 Stock Data

**Description:** This dataset contains historical stock prices for S&P 500 companies, spanning over 10 years with daily OHLC and adjusted close prices. It is ideal for portfolio optimization and stock price forecasting.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Stock Price Prediction:** Built LSTM and GRU models for forecasting stock prices.
- **Market Trend Analysis:** Applied Exponential Smoothing and Prophet to identify market trends.
- **Portfolio Risk Analysis:** Used Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall to assess risk.
- **Seasonality Detection:** Applied Fourier Transform and Wavelet Analysis to detect cyclic patterns.

### 3. Forex Exchange Rates (Currency Price Forecasting)

**Dataset:** Forex Exchange Rates

**Description:** This dataset contains daily exchange rates from 2000 to 2019 for major currencies. It is useful for macroeconomic forecasting and currency risk modeling.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting:** Predicted future rates using SARIMA and LSTMs.
- **Economic Indicator Analysis:** Explored inflation, GDP, and interest rate trends affecting forex.
- **Hedging Strategies:** Tested moving average crossovers for forex trading signals.

### 4. Financial Tweets & Stock Prices (Sentiment Analysis & Market Prediction)

**Dataset:** Stock Market Sentiment Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains financial tweets and stock market movements, making it useful for predicting stock price changes based on sentiment.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Sentiment Analysis & Market Impact:** Used NLP techniques to analyze how financial news affects stock prices.
- **Event-Based Forecasting:** Studied how breaking news and market events influence stock trends.
- **Causal Inference:** Applied Granger Causality Tests to determine if sentiment drives stock movement.

### 5. Gold Prices Dataset (Commodities Price Forecasting)

**Dataset:** Gold Prices Historical Data

**Description:** This dataset contains daily gold price data from 1979–2021. It is useful for commodity market forecasting and inflation analysis.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Gold Price Prediction:** Built XGBoost and LSTM models to forecast gold prices.
- **Inflation Hedging Analysis:** Compared gold price trends to CPI data to assess its role as an inflation hedge.
- **Safe Haven Asset Analysis:** Studied gold price behavior during financial crises.

### 6. Bank Transactions Dataset (Anomaly Detection & Fraud Detection)

**Dataset:** Synthetic Bank Transactions Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains simulated financial transaction data with timestamps, making it useful for detecting fraudulent transactions using time-series models.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Anomaly Detection:** Applied LSTM Autoencoders and Isolation Forests to identify fraudulent transactions.
- **Time-Based User Behavior Modeling:** Analyzed spending patterns to detect unusual financial activity.
- **Financial Risk Modeling:** Studied transaction frequencies to develop fraud risk scores.

### 7. US Treasury Yield Curve Rates (Macroeconomic Forecasting)

**Dataset:** US Treasury Yield Curve Rates

**Description:** This dataset contains US bond yield data from 1990 to 2019. It is useful for interest rate forecasting and recession prediction.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Yield Curve Analysis:** Studied bond yield spreads to predict economic downturns.
- **Interest Rate Forecasting:** Built VAR (Vector Autoregression) models to forecast interest rates.
- **Macroeconomic Policy Impact:** Analyzed how policy changes impact bond yields and economic stability.
